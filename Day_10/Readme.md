# 📢 Day 10 – Daily Python Challenge 🐍  

## 🚀 Challenge: "Anagram Checker" 🔄  
Today's challenge is to create an **Anagram Checker**! You need to write a Python program that takes two words, compares them, and checks whether they are **anagrams** or not. 🔍  

---

## 🔥 What is an Anagram?  
Two words are anagrams if they contain the **same letters** but in a **different order**.  
### ✅ Example:  
- **"listen"** and **"silent"** are anagrams because they have the same letters, just in a different order.  
- **"hello"** and **"world"** are **not** anagrams because their letters don’t match.  

---

## 📝 Task Requirements:  
1️⃣ Take **two words** as input from the user.  
2️⃣ Check whether the words are **anagrams** or not.  
3️⃣ Print the result:  
   - ✅ `"Yes, it's an anagram!"`  
   - ❌ `"No, it's not an anagram!"`  

---

## 📌 Example:  

Enter first word: listen  
Enter second word: silent  
Yes, it's an anagram! ✅  

Enter first word: hello  
Enter second word: world  
No, it's not an anagram! ❌
