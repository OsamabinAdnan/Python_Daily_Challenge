# 📢 Day 8 – Daily Python Challenge 🐍  

## 🚀 Challenge:  
Today's challenge is **"Number Guessing Game"**! 🎯 You need to write a Python program that generates a random number (between 1 and 100) and allows the user to guess it! 💡🔢  

## 🔥 Requirements:  
- Generate a random number between 1 and 100.  
- Take user input for their guess.  
- If the guess is correct, print **"Congratulations! You guessed it right!"**  
- If the guess is incorrect, inform the user whether the number is **higher** or **lower**.  
- The user should have multiple attempts to guess the number.  

## 📌 Example:  

- Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 50
- Too low! Try again. 
- Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 75
- Too high! Try again.
- Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 63
- Congratulations! You guessed it right!

**Happy coding! 🚀🐍**
